[FMMInfo]
Name=Remastered Halo 3 Viewmodel
Author=Intensity
Desc=This mod applies viewmodel settings similar to those of Halo 3's recommended for FOVs lower than 115. Anything higher may have clipping issues. Works best the Dany's Halo 3 weapon models but still looks great on most default models!
Version=1.5.2
EDVersion=0.5.1.1
RevisionDate=July 31st, 2017
Warning=This only affects the DEFAULT VARIANTS of weapons. None of the special f2p variants of weapons are altered seeing as this is my personal viewmodel and I do not use the other weapons. If it's requested enough, I'll change those as well.
