Hexagone Undersuit

I've done several improvements over the first iteration of the custom undersuit texture, like adding a rubber-like grain to
it and correcting the colorable areas. Now it supports a few tiny regions of the undersuit to be colored by the secondary color.
The diffuse texture was also improved to look less pixelated. i guess some issue with compression or something. anyway. enjoy
